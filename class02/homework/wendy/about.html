    <p>The series revolves around four older, single women (three widows and one divorcée) sharing a house in Miami,
        Florida. The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), who was joined by fellow
        widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur). They both responded to a
        room-for-rent ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store. The three were soon joined by Dorothy's
        mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), after the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.</p>
